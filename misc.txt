1) Finish adding the grouping to the Facevalue Stacked bar chart
2) Make the StackedBar chart interactive (mousing over a piece of the StackedBar chart should filter the pie chart with only that piece of data)
3) Update the Bar chart component to have the same dashed lines and horizontal labels that we currently have on the Product Moved StackedBar chart (see this screenshot: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8ip0k1wlw3ykur7/Screenshot%202017-05-19%2013.00.32.png?dl=0)
4) Update the Media view to show the Bar/Pie chart combo for both the Manufacturer and the Comparables (see the same screenshot above)
5) Update the regular bar chart to support multiple periods grouped together (not stacked, but side by side)
6) update the TimePeriod component to use src/data/period-data.csv




this looks different from what I was expecting...Had been planning on making these vertical grouped bar charts

Want to confirm that we want separate horizontal bar charts for the two periods instead of one grouped bar chart

cc @stephen please confirm (want to be very careful to get this right) (edited)

So we don't have to redo it


        // item not in a selected category
        // if( !nch.utils.inSelectedCategory(item) ) {
        //   continue
        // }
        //
        // if( !nch.utils.inSelectedCategory(item) ) {
        //   continue
        // }
